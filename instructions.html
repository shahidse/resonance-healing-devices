        Instructions
      </h1>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 ">
        Resonance Healing.ai enables vibrational remedy information to be
        entered either by typing in the name of the remedy you want or by typing
        in a Radionic Rate. Due to the way the app operates, there is no limit
        as to what a remedy might be. The app serves to synthesise remedy
        vibrations; remedies are not accessed from an internal database.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mt-2">
        Names or rates of remedies required are entered into any one of the
        three drop-down fields labeled "Set Remedy or Type COPY." More than one
        remedy can be entered on each line, provided that remedies are separated
        by either a space or a comma.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mt-2">
        Names or rates relating to information entered and then potentised are
        recorded in the drop-down boxes and may be recalled by clicking on them.
        Information entered can be cleared temporarily by clicking on the reset
        button or cleared permanently from the drop-down lists by clicking on
        the "Clear" button.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mt-2">
        When quitting the app, a Notepad file is automatically created in the
        same directory as the app called "Last Remedy." This file records all
        information that was entered or changed: the names of remedies, the
        potencies used, the power level in units, the time period, and even the
        text and background color you used. This file is updated the next time
        you make a remedy. If you wish, you can save the information by renaming
        the "Last Remedy" file (don’t worry, the app will create a new one) or
        by clicking on <em class="font-bold">File > Save</em> As to save a copy
        from within the app. To recall saved information, click on
        <em class="font-bold">File > Open</em> and browse for the saved file
        location.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mt-2">
        The app includes drop-down potency boxes, allowing the creation of
        homoeopathic remedies from 1 - 9999 X, C, M, CM, MM, and LM or D. If no
        potency is required, both potency boxes may be cleared. An additional
        useful feature is a power control calibrated in units. The default
        setting is 30 units, the power level of standard homoeopathic remedies
        purchased at a pharmacy. Remedies may be made with power levels of 10 -
        1600 units, though higher levels (above 250 units) are for experimental
        applications only. The app includes timer-controlled energisation. The
        timer can be set using a drop-down box to provide a time period of 3 -
        30 seconds, although adequate potentisation may be achieved with the
        default 3 seconds.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mt-2">
        Two other energy programs are available in the app:
      </p>

      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mt-2 ">
        <ul style="list-style-type: square" class="pl-4 text-gray-300 mt-2 bg-blue-800 rounded">
            <li class="">
              <em class="font-bold">Lock Function:</em> Prevents remedies from losing potency if stored near
              strong-smelling substances or subjected to physical impact.
            </li>
            <li>
                <em class="font-bold">Program Function: </em>Allows you to define specific qualities for your remedy, such as "this remedy will stay in the body for 10 minutes only" or "this remedy will radiate a distance of 2 feet diameter from the bottle."
            </li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mt-2">
        All buttons in the app are operated by clicking on them, and the "Potentise" button can also be operated by pressing the Enter key.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mt-2">
        You can also create a multiple remedy with different potencies for each ingredient. To do so, click on <em class="font-bold">Remedy > Programme</em>Remedy > Programme, where you can type in as many remedy names and potencies as required.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mt-2">
        The app includes a <em class="font-bold">Color Remedy Generator</em>. To access it, click on <em class="font-bold">Remedy > Color Rem</em>. In the rectangle in the middle of the screen, a color picker allows you to select any of thousands of possible colors. You can assign a homoeopathic potency to your color remedy or leave the potency fields blank if it is intended as an energy remedy. The "Last Remedy" file is updated with this information, or you can save it manually by clicking on <em class="font-bold">File > Save As</em>.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700 mt-2">
        The app also includes an <em class="font-bold">Energy Memory</em> feature. This can be activated to store remedies created in the app, allowing them to be broadcast continually even after the app is closed. The Energy Memory also has an erase function to clear stored information when needed.
